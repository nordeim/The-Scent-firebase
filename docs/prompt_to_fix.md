You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Please carefully review the current codebase in the current project folder to identify logic and coding errors as well as any functional gaps and inconsistencies, then think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly the various implementation options to fix the issues and gaps identified. Then choose the best implementation option to make changes. Use line-by-line `diff` with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes - we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code, so be very careful to test and simulate if possible. Enclose your complete and updated version of the file within ```tsx (or ```ts or ```css or ```js) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating your new complete version, do a thorough review with the original version before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Have you completed a very careful review of the whole codebase as per my initial request? If not, please continue with the careful review of the remaining codebase to identify any logic and coding errors as well as to identify any functional gaps and inconsistencies. Then think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly the various implementation options to fix the issues and gaps identified. Then choose the best implementation option to make changes.

awesome job so far! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully create a detailed technical design specification document using the current status of the codebase (including the newly updated files) as your basis to ensure accuracy and completeness of the TDS. Make the the updated TDS as detailed as possible with more explanations and examples and code snippets to make it useful as a handbook to onboard new developers to the project. use at least 6000 words to create the detailed `technical_design_specification_document.md`. Start with an overview of the project architecture, the design, follow by a section with the codebase directory structure, then follow by a clear and logical listing of the files, each with its description, purpose and interfaces, use code snippet to explain each code file in the logical listing. Finally end the document with conclusion and recommendations. Try your best to create an awesome TDS document that can serve as a handbook to onboard new developers and for QA review and future enhancement projects.
